Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with.

This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop.

With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time.
